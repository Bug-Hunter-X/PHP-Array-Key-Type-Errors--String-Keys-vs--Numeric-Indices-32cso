In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not strictly numeric.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$data = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];

foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
  // Incorrect assumption: $key is always a string
  if ($key == 1) { //This will always be false
    echo "Key is 1: " . $value . "\n";
  }
  if ($key === '1') { //This will also always be false
    echo "Key is '1': " . $value . "\n";
  }
}
```

The code intends to check if a key with the value '1' exists. However, the keys are strings ('a', 'b', 'c'), not integers. Using loose comparison (`==`) or strict comparison (`===`) will always result in `false`.

Another example involves using array keys in a numerical context without explicit type casting:

```php
$data = ['a' => 1, 1 => 2, 'b' => 3];

for ($i = 0; $i < count($data); $i++) {
    echo $data[$i] . "\n"; //undefined for index 0, will output 2 for index 1, undefined for index 2
}

foreach($data as $key => $value){
    echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
```

This leads to unexpected behavior.  `$data[0]` will return `null` or an error because array keys are not implicitly numerical indices.  The `foreach` loop correctly iterates through all key-value pairs, but the `for` loop's logic is flawed.

This error often manifests in situations involving data manipulation from external sources (e.g., databases, APIs), where keys might have unexpected types.
