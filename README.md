# PHP Array Key Type Errors

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in PHP programming related to the types of array keys. Specifically, it highlights the issues that can arise when mixing string keys and integer indices, and using loose/strict comparisons incorrectly.

## Problem

PHP arrays can have keys that are either strings or integers. However, improper handling of these key types can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when attempting comparisons or accessing array elements using numerical indices.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates correct handling of array keys by ensuring consistent type checking and avoiding implicit conversions between strings and integers.  Explicit type casting is crucial for reliable array operations.  The solution provides examples that use proper comparison techniques and loops appropriately designed to handle both string and integer keys.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.php` script.
3. Observe the unexpected output.

## How to Fix the Bug

1. Run the `bugSolution.php` script.
2. Observe the correct output.

This example emphasizes the importance of clear understanding of data types and consistent handling of array keys in PHP to prevent unforeseen issues in your applications.
